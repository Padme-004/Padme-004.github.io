<h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue ">What is MINDSPACE?</h1>
  <hr>
<h3 class="text"> NITTE MINDSPACE is our first year internship project. It is a website designed to showcase the commonness of the problems faced by all people, which often seem alienating when
  considered from an individual standpoint. Having done so, we wish to offer a simple outlet for advice and support</h3>

<h1 style="background-color:DodgerBlue">  Why did we choose this project?</p>
<hr>
<h3 class="text">  Mental health is a rising concern. Often, the life experiences of others can provide fuel to the dwindling fire of our own courage. The idea that someone else is
  undergoing something of the same nature is one that inspires a sense of kinmanship. <br> If our website can bring just the one smile on a sullen face, or just the one ember
of that hope which makes us try again despite failure- then to us, it shall surely be a roaring success. <br> P.S. Also- to learn web development skills!</h3>
<br><br><br>
<h1 style="color:gold">RESULTS OF OUR SURVEY</h1>
<p> The results of our survery will be uploaded in slideshow format once it has garnered 60 responses</p>
